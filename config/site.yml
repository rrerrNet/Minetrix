# This list defines all the assets that should be built.  By default it only
# includes the main application style sheet.
#
# All image assets will be added to the assets pipeline automatically.
#
# To use an asset in a view, you can use the `assets_path` helper, e.g:
#
#    %img{src: asset_path("lisp-alien.png")}
#
# For style sheets, you can use the `stylesheet_link_tag` helper:
#
#    = stylesheet_link_tag("application.css")
